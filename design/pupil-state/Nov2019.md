## Check 'not received' status and function
continually administer the check table via a process to mark checks as 'not received'?
OR
infer the 'not received' due to time differences on active checks?

must send message back to admin to update check table. (this is the 'collected' state)

## Check started
remove check started status.
remove function
remove call in SPA that submits to queue, and instead store it in the payload.
we have a server side timestamp for login, so we can ascertain the actual check started time relative to the login time.
this is transient information 'on the day'.

we want to remove this and replace with overnight job that batch purges preparedCheck table.
OR
use redis for pupil logon

get rid of expired status.
completely remove this functionality.
