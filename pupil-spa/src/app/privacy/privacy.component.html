        <p>
          This work is being carried out by the Standards and Testing Agency (STA) which is part of the Department for Education (DfE).
          For the purpose of data protection legislation, DfE is the data controller for the personal data processed as part of MTC.

      <div id="how-we-will-use-information">
        <h3 class="heading-medium">How we will use your information</h3>
        <p>We receive your pupils’ personal data from your school.</p>
        <p>The aim of this project is to determine whether pupils can recall their times tables fluently,
          which is essential for future success in mathematics. It will help schools to identify pupils who have not yet mastered their times tables,
          so that additional support can be provided. Further <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/multiplication-tables-check">information about MTC</a> is available on GOV.UK.

        <h3 class="heading-medium">The nature of personal data we will be using</h3>
        <p>
          The categories of your pupils’ personal data that we will be using for this project are:
        </p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>full name</li>
          <li>gender</li>

          <li>unique pupil number (UPN)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="legal">
        <h3 class="heading-medium">Why our use of your pupils’ personal data is lawful</h3>
        <p>
          In order for our use of personal data to be lawful,
          we need to meet one (or more) conditions in the data protection legislation.
          For the purpose of this project, the relevant condition is:
        </p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>Article 6(1)(e) GDPR, to perform a public task as part of our function as a department</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Data Protection Act 2018, Part 2 Chapter 2 Lawfulness of processing Section 8 (d) allows
          for when (data) processing is necessary for the exercise of a function of the Crown,
          a Minister of the Crown or a government department.

      <div id="personal-data-available">
        <h3 class="heading-medium">Who we will make your pupils’ personal data available to</h3>
        <p>
          We sometimes need to make personal data available to other organisations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where we need to share your pupils’ personal data with others, we will only do this where the law allows us to.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="personal-data">
        <h3 class="heading-medium">How long we will keep your pupils’ personal data</h3>
        <p>
          DfE will keep your pupils’ personal data, that is the personal details listed above, alongside the pupils’ MTC score for 2 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The MTC database for each annual test cycle will (in line with STA data retention policy) be retained for a maximum of 2 years
          after each cycle (encrypted at rest in Enterprise Azure).
          This is in case we need to extract the data again (for disaster recovery purposes) or to retrieve
          to inform any subsequently received allegation of test maladministration. The data will be securely destroyed once it is no longer required.
          Please note, under section 33 of the Data Protection Act 1998, and in compliance with the relevant conditions,
          we can lawfully keep personal data processed purely for research purposes indefinitely,
          although the personal data at this point is now anonymised.
