                <p>
                  The Standards and Testing Agency (STA) is an executive agency of the Department for Education (DfE),
                  responsible for the development and delivery of assessments for children in education between reception
                  and the end of key stage 2 (KS2).
                </p>
                <p>
                  This privacy notice outlines the personal data we will collect, process and store for the KS2 multiplication tables check (MTC).
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the purpose of data protection legislation, DfE is the data controller.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="personal-data-we-use">
                <h3 class="heading-medium">The personal data we use</h3>
                <p>
                  Personal data is sourced from the pupil census data provided by schools to DfE.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also receive pupils’ personal data from schools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pupil personal data that will be used are:
                </p>

                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>full name</li>
                    <li>gender</li>

            <div id="usage">
                <h3 class="heading-medium">How we use your information</h3>
                <p>
                  The data collected is used to create the pupil register and confirm pupils participating in the MTC,
                  which enables us to deliver the assessment to all year 4 pupils.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The purpose of the MTC is to determine whether pupils can fluently recall their times tables,
                  which is essential for future success in mathematics. We also provide the results back to schools to help
                  them identify pupils who have not yet mastered their times table and may require more support.

                <p>
                  For our use of your personal data to be lawful, we need to meet one (or more) conditions in the data protection legislation.
                  For the purpose of this piece of work, the processing is necessary for DfE to exercise its functions of
