      <p>
        This statement applies to content published on the multiplication tables check (MTC) service.
        This includes the school administration application accessed via DfE Sign-in and the pupil try it out and official
        <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pupil.multiplication-tables-check.service.gov.uk/">check application.</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        We are committed to making the MTC service accessible and user-friendly for school staff and pupils, regardless of any physical, cognitive or emotional impairment.
      </p>

        You can read a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/">

      <h3 class="heading-medium">Our commitment to accessibility</h3>

      <p>
        The Standards and Testing Agency (STA) is committed to making websites accessible,
        in accordance with The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">Conformance status</h3>

      <p>
        We seek to ensure that most of the service meets the
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">
          Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> <img alt="" src="/images/icon-link.png"/>
        2.1 at Level AA. The MTC is partially conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA.
      </p>

      <p>Partially conformant means that some parts of the content do not fully conform to the accessibility standard.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">Pupil site</h3>

      <p>The MTC pupil application does not support third-party screen readers due to compatibility issues with the timed element of the check.</p>

      <p>
        To address this and other accessibility needs, a number of access arrangements can be applied to the pupil check.
        The following table shows which access arrangement compatibility with browsers and devices.
      </p>

      <table class="table-font-xsmall">

      <h3 class="heading-medium">School administration website</h3>

      <p>The school administration website does not currently have any built-in access arrangements.</p>

      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>job access with speech (JAWS)</li>
        <li>non-visual desktop access (NVDA)</li>
        <li>voicevoer</li>
      </ul>


      <p>The website has also been designed to be compatible with:</p>

      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>basic operating system screen magnifiers, such as ZoomText magnifier</li>
        <li>speech recognition software, such as Dragon Naturally Speaking</li>
        <li>operating system speech packages</li>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">How accessible this website is</h3>

      <p>Parts of the MTC service are not fully accessible for example:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>some feedback messages are not clearly associated with form fields, instead all feedback is presented at the top of the page.</li>
        <li>focus indicators and tab order for keyboard users may be inconsistent with the layout.</li>
        <li>some elements and images are missing descriptive alternative text, their function should, however, be evident by their location.</li>
        <li>the “loading wheel” animation continues for longer than 3 seconds and cannot be paused.</li>
        <li>users are not warned of the idle 5-minute time-out function on pages until notified by a notification box. There is no option to extend or turn off this 5-minute time-out function.</li>
        <li>the "skip to main content" function does not always move the cursor to the main content.</li>
        <li>the search function and filter controls automatically update the content presented as input is given.</li>
        <li>some tables in the service are not presented as tables or are missing headers. The layout is, however, consistent.</li>
        <li>the structure, formatting, and use of headings may not be consistent or defined across the service.</li>
        <li>with some presented information some elements do not have unique IDs for assistive technologies. Their content is, however, sufficiently unique to ascertain their purpose.</li>
        <li>some elements such as filters and controls will not be accessible by keyboard. Please use the search box where possible to navigate the site and manual operation may be required.</li>
        <li>screen reader users may have a different experience to content provided on screen.</li>
      </ul>
