      <p>
        This statement applies to content published on the
        <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pupil.multiplication-tables-check.service.gov.uk/">MTC pupil check application</a> and school administration area of the MTC.
        We're constantly working to make the MTC accessible and user-friendly for all pupils, regardless of any physical,
        cognitive or emotional impairment.
      </p>

        You can read a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/">

      <h3 class="heading-medium">Our commitment to accessibility</h3>

      <p>
        The Standards and Testing Agency (STA) is committed to making websites accessible,
        in accordance with The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">Conformance status</h3>

      <p>
        We seek to ensure that all aspects of the service meet the
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">
          Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> <img alt="" src="/images/icon-link.png"/>
        2.1 at Level AA. The MTC is partially conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA.
      </p>

      <p>Partially conformant means that some parts of the content do not fully conform to the accessibility standard.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">Pupil site</h3>

      <p>The MTC does not support third-party screen readers due to compatibility issues with the timed element of the check.</p>

      <p>
        To address this, there are a number of access arrangements that can be applied to the pupil check.
        The following table shows which access arrangements are compatible with each device.
      </p>

      <table class="table-font-xsmall">
        <thead>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">Teacher site</h3>

        <li>non-visual desktop access (NVDA)</li>
        <li>voiceOver</li>

      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>basic operating system screen magnifiers, such as ZoomText magnifier</li>
        <li>speech recognition software, such as Dragon Naturally Speaking</li>
