# Dockerized AzureDevops (VSO) Build Agent

## Purpose

- `build-push-registry.sh` Builds the agent docker image and pushes it to your azure container registry.  Any changes must be committed before running this script, as the commit hash is used for the image tag.  You must be logged into your target registry before you run this script.
- `cleanup.sh` Removes any temporary files and 'dead weight' from the image before it is finished building.  You do not need to execute this script, as it is called from within the Dockerfile itself.
- `create-instance.sh` creates a container instance using the latest image in your registry, via the Azure CLI.

## NOTE: Apple Silicon
If you are building the image locally on an Apple Silicon device during developmet, you should use the `--platform linux/amd64` argument with the `docker build` command.  Otherwise, it will default to arm64, which lacks parity with the target hardware, and causes a lot of incompatibility issues during the image build.

## Steps
1. update the `$AGENT_VERSION` variable in `./Dockerfile` to the [latest full release](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-agent/releases)
2. commit changes to ensure commit hash is aligned
3. execute `./build-push-registry.sh` to push new image
4. delete existing build server container instances in azure
5. run `./create-instance.sh` to create new build servers
6. once created, connect to each container via the azure portal and run `curl 'https://api.ipify.org?format=json'`
7. Add the outputted IP addresses to the necessary firewalls using the build tasks provided in Azure DevOps instance

If you are unable to connect to any of the containers using the azure portal, use the alternative method below to obtain the IP address.

### Alternative method of IP retrieval
1. once new agents are up and running, assign a 'user defined capability' to each one via the build agent management screen in VSO.
2. Add name as `mtc-instance` and number them consecutively, starting at 1.  This allows us to source and whitelist the IP address of each.
3. Source the IPv4 address of each build server using the build definition 'Get Build Server IP Address'
