# Custom circleci docker file

## Reason

We want to run multiple versions of node in the same test matrix.  CircleCI official docker images do not provide support
for `freetds` - a library required for `tiny_tds`

## Availability

This docker image needs to be made publicly available so we can pull it in when launching our circleci jobs.

### Publishing

1. Build it

$ docker build . -t stamtc/mtc_circleci_ruby

2. Push it

$ docker push stamtc/mtc_circleci_ruby:latest
