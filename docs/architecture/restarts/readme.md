# Restarts

If a Pupils Live Check is spoiled, they will need to restart the check.  The restart is created by the teacher or headteacher associated with the same school as the pupil.  The spoiled check will not be included in the results, and the Pupil can now have a new pin generated, and they will need to retake the check from the start.
