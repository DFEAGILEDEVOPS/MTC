- [Back to Architecture Home](../readme.md)

## Overview

The Check Submission process is the final step in the Pupil Check process.  Once a pupil has completed the check, the payload is submitted to the back-end for validation and marking.  The payload is a JSON object that contains all of the answers given to the questions, user input telemetry and timings.
