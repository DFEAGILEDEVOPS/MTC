# MTC Data Inputs and Outputs

## Inputs

There are 2 main data sources that are loaded into MTC
1. Establishment Data File (UK Schools)
2. Pupil Census File

### Establishment Data File (UK Schools)

The Establishment Data File is a CSV file that contains information about schools in the UK. The file is uploaded by the Service Manager and a set of predicates determine whether each entry should be inserted into the school table.

This must be uploaded before the Pupil Census File, as each pupil is mapped to a corresponding school in the Establishment Data File.

### Pupil Census File

The Pupil Census File is a CSV file that contains information about every pupil in the UK. The file is uploaded by the Service Manager and each row is mapped to the relevant school and inserted into the pupil table.

## Outputs

There are 2 main outputs that are generated by MTC
- PS Report
- School Results

### PS Report

The PS Report is generated on demand, and contains a row for every pupil in the pupil table.  More information on the PS Report can be found in the [PS Report documentation](docs/architecture/ps-report/readme.md).

### School Results

School results are calculated at the end of the current Check Window, and are made available to users of the admin app (typically teachers & headteachers).
