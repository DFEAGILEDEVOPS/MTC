# MTC Pupil API

## Dependencies

You need to have node installed

- [node](https://nodejs.org/) - Node javascript runtime
- [NPM packages](https://www.npmjs.org) installed globally (for developers): `yarn`
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker) - Docker to run containers

We recommend developers manage their `node` and `npm` packages using [nvm](http://nvm.sh)

## Packages

You _can_ use npm to install application packages, but we prefer [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)
You can then install all required dependencies by running:

`yarn install`

See the [package.json](./package.json) file for the full list of npm dependencies.

## Running the application

`AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=xxx AZURE_SERVICE_BUS_CONNECTION_STRING=xxx yarn start`

Will launch the app in development mode on http://localhost:3003/

CORS is disabled in development. In production the whitelist can be configured using the CORS_WHITELIST environment variable.

## Swagger API Documentation

When running in development the api documentation can be found at http://localhost:3003/api-docs

## Environment Variables

dotenv is installed and will load environment variables from a `.env` file stored in the root of the admin application,
if you have created one.  See [documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) for more info.

* AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING - (required when redis prepared checks disable) - Storage account for upload file storage and queues.  Upload is only enabled for
    production environments, but the queues are used by all environments.
