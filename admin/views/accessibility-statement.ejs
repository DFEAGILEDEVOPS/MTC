            <p class="govuk-body">
                We seek to ensure that most of the service meets the

            <p class="govuk-body">Partially conformant means that some parts of
            the content do not fully conform to the accessibility standard.</p>

                To address this and other accessibility needs, a number of

                <li>some feedback messages are not clearly associated with form fields, instead all feedback is presented at the top of the page.</li>

                <li>some elements and images are missing descriptive alternative text, their function should, however, be evident by their location.</li>
                <li>the “loading wheel” animation continues for longer than 3 seconds and cannot be paused.</li>
                <li>users are not warned of the idle 5-minute time-out function on pages until notified by a notification box. There is no option to extend or turn off this 5-minute time-out function.</li>
                <li>the "skip to main content" function does not always move the cursor to the main content.</li>
                <li>the search function and filter controls automatically update the content presented as input is given.</li>
                <li>some tables in the service are not presented as tables or are missing headers. The layout is, however, consistent.</li>
                <li>the structure, formatting, and use of headings may not be consistent or defined across the service.</li>
                <li>with some presented information some elements do not have unique IDs for assistive technologies. Their content is, however, sufficiently unique to ascertain their purpose.</li>
                <li>some elements such as filters and controls will not be accessible by keyboard. Please use the search box where possible to navigate the site and manual operation may be required.</li>
                <li>screen reader users may have a different experience to content provided on screen.</li>
