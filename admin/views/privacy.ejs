                    The Standards and Testing Agency (STA) is an executive agency of the Department for Education (DfE).
                    For the purpose of data protection legislation, DfE is the data controller for the personal data
                    processed. STA is responsible for the development and delivery of assessments for children in
                    education between reception up to and including key stage 2.

                <p>
                    The aim of the multiplication tables check (MTC) is to determine whether pupils can recall their
                    times tables fluently, which is essential for future success in mathematics. It will help schools to
                    identify pupils who have not yet mastered their times tables, so that additional support can be
                    provided. Further

                <p>
                    The pupil personal data that will be used are:

                <p>
                    We use your pupil information to enable us to deliver an online check to each pupil to determine
                    whether year 4 pupils can fluently recall their times tables. We also provide the results back to
                    schools to help them identify pupils who may require more support to master them.

                <p>
                    For our use of your personal data to be lawful, we need to meet one (or more) conditions in the data
                    protection legislation. For the purpose of this project, the processing is necessary for the
                    department to exercise its functions of administering national curriculum assessments.

                    2003/1038 specifies the assessment arrangements for pupils who have completed the programme of study
                    for the second key stage as they apply to schools maintained by local authorities in England, and to
                    academies through their funding agreements.

                    As 2021 is an optional year for participation it has been agreed that pupils’ personal data will
                    only be made available to the school the pupil is registered with who participate in the check.
