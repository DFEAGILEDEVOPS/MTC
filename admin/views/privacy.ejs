                    The Standards and Testing Agency (STA) is an executive
                    agency of the Department for Education (DfE), responsible
                    for the development and delivery of assessments for children
                    in education between reception and the end of key stage 2
                    (KS2).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This privacy notice outlines the personal data we will
                    collect, process and store for the KS2 multiplication tables
                    check (MTC).
                </p
                <p>
                    For the purpose of data protection legislation, DfE is the
                    data controller.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="personal-data-we-use">
                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">The personal data we use</h3>
                <p>
                    Personal data is sourced from the pupil census data provided
                    by schools to DfE.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We also receive pupils’ personal data from schools.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The pupil personal data that will be used are:
                </p>

                    <li>full name</li>
                    <li>gender</li>
                    <li>date of birth</li>
                    <li>unique pupil number (UPN)</li>
                </ul>

            <div id="usage">
                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How we use your information</h3>
                <p>
                    The data collected is used to create the pupil register and
                    confirm pupils participating in the MTC, which enables us to
                    deliver the assessment to all year 4 pupils.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of the MTC is to determine whether pupils can
                    fluently recall their times tables, which is essential for
                    future success in mathematics. We also provide the results
                    back to schools to help them identify pupils who have not
                    yet mastered their times table and may require more support.

                <p>
                    For our use of your personal data to be lawful, we need to
                    meet one (or more) conditions in the data protection
                    legislation. For the purpose of this piece of work, the
                    processing is necessary for DfE to exercise its functions of
                    administering national curriculum assessments.
