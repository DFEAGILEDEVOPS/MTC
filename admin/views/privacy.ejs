                The Standards and Testing Agency (STA) will use the results of the final 2019 multiplication tables check (MTC) trial and national pilot to:

                <li>
                    develop and refine the live pilot digital service for implementing MTC as a final live service development

            </ul>

            <p>
                As data processor, STA is responsible for securely storing and handling any personal data required to
                administer both the final trial and national pilot checks. We will keep data for only as long as it is
                required for research and operational purposes, and will regularly review retention of the data, in
                accordance and in line with the requirements of UK data protection legislation and the

        <div id="data-collection-and-access">
            <h3 class="heading-medium">What data will be collected and who can access it?</h3>
            <p>We will collect and hold the following categories of data:</p>

            <ul class="list list-bullet">
                <li>participating pupils’ names</li>
                <li>participating pupils’ dates of birth</li>
                <li>participating pupils’ unique pupil numbers</li>
                <li>names of participating schools</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The MTC check will be completed online by all eligible year 4 pupils (age 8-9) who schools agree and
                decide to enter for the trial or national pilot in 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
                STA will store the data collected securely within its own system and retain it in line with the agency’s
                data retention policy. Access within STA will be restricted to those employees who need to see the pupil
                data. Schools will also see the data for their participating pupils.

        <div id="retaining-personal-data">
            <h3 class="heading-medium">How long will we keep your data?</h3>
            <p>
                STA will only keep personal data for as long as it is needed for the purpose of the trialling and
                service development of the live check. STA will retain the data for no longer than necessary, in
                accordance with the law, and will systematically review and manage retention. The data will be securely
                destroyed once it is no longer required. Please note, under section 33 of the Data Protection Act 1998,
                and in compliance with the relevant conditions, we can lawfully keep personal data processed purely for
                research purposes indefinitely.

            <h3 class="heading-medium">What is the legal basis for collecting and processing the data?</h3>
            <p>
                The Data Protection Act 2018, Part 2 Chapter 2 Lawfulness of processing Section 8 (d) allows for when
                (data) processing is necessary for the exercise of a function of the Crown, a Minister of the Crown or a
                government department. For the processing of personal data, the relevant condition is Article 6 (1) (e)
                of GDPR.
