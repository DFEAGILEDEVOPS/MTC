# MTC Azure Functions

See [offical documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference-node) for full
developer reference.

We are targeting V2, which is currently in preview.

## Pre-requisites

- Install Azure Functions Core tools as per [the documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools).

  `npm i -g azure-functions-core-tools@core`

- For versions of `azure-functions-core-tools >= 2.0.1-beta.37` you also need to install the extensions

    `func extensions install`

NB: you can review what npm packages and versions are installed:
    `npm list -g --depth=0`

## Running locally

execute `func host start` from `functions` directory.  A shortcut script has been added to `package.json` so you can
also just call `yarn start` if you prefer.

the functions depend on a `local.settings.json` file when running locally.  This is purposely ignored by git and should be of the following format...

```
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node",
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "<connection-string>",
    "AzureWebJobsDashboard": "<connection-string>",
    "AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING": "<your-storage-connection-string>"
  }
}
```

## Creating a new function

From the `functions` directory, execute `func function new`.

## Installing package dependencies

npm packages should be installed in the `functions` root folder, not in each function directory.
