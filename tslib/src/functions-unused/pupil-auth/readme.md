# Pupil Auth API function

Proof of concept for performance comparison against the existing 'hand rolled' pupil-api express application.

In November 2019 we stress tested this azure function implementation of the pupil auth http endpoint against the one written as an express application in typescript.

The Azure function did not perform particularly well in comparison, so is now considered archived.
