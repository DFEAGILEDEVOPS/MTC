# Multiplication Tables Check (MTC) Project

Requires Docker 17.05 or later.

## Docker Compose

There are 2 docker files...

### docker-compose.yml
The default, which runs just SQL Server (main data store) and MongoDB (express session store)
`docker-compose up`

### docker-compose.ci.yml
Runs SQL Server, MongoDB, all web applications, and the pupil and admin test suites as separate containers.
`docker-compose -f docker-compose.ci.yml up`
In order to exit with a non-zero exit code during CI, execute the `run-compose-test-suite.sh` bash script instead, which will monitor the compose containers for non-zero exit codes (typically generated by the test suites when they fail) and exit appropriately.

Once the compose stack is up and running, browse to....

* http://localhost:3001 (Admin App)
* http://localhost:80 (Pupil App)

The MTC solution consists of the following projects...

- Pupil Check Application (`/pupil-spa/`) Angular SPA
- Check Administration Application (`/admin/`) Express MVC application
- Electron Container for Pupil Check Application (`/electron/`) Electron shell for Pupil Check Application (Obsolete)

See each projects readme for app specifics.
